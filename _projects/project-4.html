<p></p>OSIP is a platform run by the European Space Agency to collect and evaluate innovative ideas from individuals, companies, and research institutions. Since its creation in 2018, it has gathered a valuable dataset of disruptive space-related ideas from various domains. I have developed an agentic workflow to cluster <a href="https://ideas.esa.int/servlet/hype/IMT?documentTableId=45087218054705371&userAction=Browse&templateName=&documentId=084c11fe4a9679bf192774977870faba">OSIP ideas</a> by topic and identify the emerging technologies within these topics.</p>

<p>Honestly, I really enjoyed this project. I used the <em>mistral-small-latest</em> model from Mistral AI, which performed well in text summarization, topic categorization, assigning projects to relevant topics, and generating descriptions and insights from trends. It also gave me a clear picture of the latest developments in the space sector 👀</p>   

<p>Stay tuned, I am going to deploy it on OSIP in Q3/Q4 2025 👩‍💻</p>
