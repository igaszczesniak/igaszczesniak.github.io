Since its creation in 2018, it has gathered a valuable dataset of thousands of disruptive R&D project proposals from all space-related domains. I developed an agentic workflow to cluster OSIP ideas by topic and identify emerging technologies within these clusters.</p>

<p>Honestly, I really enjoyed this project. I used the <em>Mistral large</em> model from Mistral AI, which performed well in text summarization, labelling, assigning projects to relevant categories, and generating descriptions and insights. It also gave me a clear picture of the latest advancements in the space sector 👀</p>   

<p>Stay tuned, I plan to deploy it on OSIP in 2026! 👩‍💻</p>
