Since its creation in 2018, it has gathered a valuable dataset of disruptive R&D project proposals from various aerospace domains. I developed an agentic workflow to cluster OSIP ideas by topic and identify emerging technologies within these clusters.</p>

<p>Honestly, I really enjoyed this project. I used the <em>mistral-small-latest</em> model from Mistral AI, which performed well in text summarization, labelling, assigning projects to relevant topics, and generating descriptions and insights. It also gave me a clear picture of the latest developments in the space sector. 👀</p>   

<p>Stay tuned, I am going to deploy it on OSIP in Q3/Q4 2025! 👩‍💻</p>
