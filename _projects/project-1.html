excerpt: "Measuring the spectral signatures of grass across various pastures on Terceira Island, Azores."

---

The primary goal of this field campaign was to assess the spectral signatures of grass across various pastures, both with and without spores of Pithomyces chartarum, at different altitudes. This involved using optical data from satellites, drone, and in-situ measurements with a spectroradiometer. With the data from this campaign, the influence of grass quality and nutrients on spore production will be studied through the use of existing vegetation indices or developing new ones, based on the spectral signatures obtained.
