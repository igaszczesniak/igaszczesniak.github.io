Hi there! I'm Iga.

I'm a Space Innovation Engineer at the European Space Agency. I hold an MSc in Remote Sensing from AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow and Aalto University in Espoo, Finland. 

Over time, I have become increasingly interested in the commercialisation of space technology and its potential to address global challenges, meet public needs, and inform policy. To deepen my expertise, I have completed several cross-disciplinary courses in data science, AI, and project and product management.

My career goal is to connect cutting-edge space technologies, data, ideas, and people to drive innovation and create positive impact. I have professional experience across the space sector, including work within multiple ESA directorates (ESRIN, ESTEC and HQ) and at the AIR Centre EO Lab, a research center focused on Earth observation and data science.

In my current role, I assess space-related technologies, R&D projects, and emerging trends to support ESA’s long-term strategic preparedness. Though I am particularly interested in:

* Earth Observation 
* Artificial Intelligence
* Signal Processing 
* Computer Vision 
* Next-Gen Sensor Networks

Other than that, I engage in *a lot* of outdoor activities, especially kitesurfing, scuba diving, freediving, snowboarding, climbing, running and more.
