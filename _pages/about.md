Hi there! I'm Iga.

I'm a Space Innovation Engineer at the European Space Agency. I hold an MSc in Remote Sensing from AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow and Aalto University in Finland, along with a master's in Space Entrepreneurship from the European Institute of Innovation for Sustainability. 

Over time, I have become increasingly interested in the commercialization of space technology and its potential to address global challenges, meet public needs, and inform policy. To deepen my expertise, I have completed several cross-disciplinary courses in data science, AI, and project/product management.

My career goal is to connect cutting-edge space technologies, data, ideas, and people to drive innovation and make a positive change. I have over three years of professional experience in the space sector, working across various ESA directorates (ESRIN, HQ) and the AIR Centre EO Lab, a research centre dedicated to Earth observation.

In my current role, I analyze various space-related technologies, R&D projects, and emerging trends in the space sector to help prepare the agency for the future. Though I am particularly interested in:

* Earth Observation 
* Artificial Intelligence
* Signal Processing 
* Computer Vision 
* Next-Gen Sensor Networks

I engage in *a lot* of outdoor activities, especially kitesurfing, scuba diving, freediving, snowboarding, cross-country skiing, climbing, and more. Other than that, I try my best to write a children's book about satellites and adventures.
